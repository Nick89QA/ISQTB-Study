## Reviews: From Informal to Formal

Reviews vary from informal to formal. Informal reviews are characterized by not following a defined process and not having formal documented output. Formal reviews are characterized by team participation, documented results of the review, and documented procedures for conducting the review. The formality of a review process is related to factors such as the software development lifecycle model, the maturity of the development process, the complexity of the work product to be reviewed, any legal or regulatory requirements, and/or the need for an audit trail.

The focus of a review depends on the agreed objectives of the review (e.g., finding defects, gaining understanding, educating participants such as testers and new team members, or discussing and deciding by consensus).

The ISO standard (ISO/IEC 20246) contains more in-depth descriptions of the review process for work products, including roles and review techniques.

## 3.2.1 Work Product Review Process

The review process comprises the following main activities:

### Planning

- Defining the scope, which includes the purpose of the review, what documents or parts of documents to review, and the quality characteristics to be evaluated
- Estimating effort and timeframe
- Identifying review characteristics such as the review type with roles, activities, and checklists
- Selecting the people to participate in the review and allocating roles
- Defining the entry and exit criteria for more formal review types (e.g., inspections)
- Checking that entry criteria are met (for more formal review types)

### Initiate Review

- Distributing the work product (physically or by electronic means) and other material, such as issue log forms, checklists, and related work products
- Explaining the scope, objectives, process, roles, and work products to the participants
- Answering any questions that participants may have about the review

### Individual Review (i.e., Individual Preparation)

- Reviewing all or part of the work product
- Noting potential defects, recommendations, and questions

### Issue Communication and Analysis

- Communicating identified potential defects (e.g., in a review meeting)
- Analyzing potential defects, assigning ownership and status to them
- Evaluating and documenting quality characteristics
- Evaluating the review findings against the exit criteria to make a review decision (reject; major changes needed; accept, possibly with minor changes)

### Fixing and Reporting

- Creating defect reports for those findings that require changes to a work product
- Fixing defects found (typically done by the author) in the work product reviewed
- Communicating defects to the appropriate person or team (when found in a work product related to the work product reviewed)
- Recording updated status of defects (in formal reviews), potentially including the agreement of the comment originator
- Gathering metrics (for more formal review types)
- Checking that exit criteria are met (for more formal review types)
- Accepting the work product when the exit criteria are reached

The results of a work product review vary, depending on the review type and formality, as described in section 3.2.3.

## 3.2.2 Roles and Responsibilities in a Formal Review

A typical formal review will include the roles below:

### Author

- Creates the work product under review
- Fixes defects in the work product under review (if necessary)

### Management

- Is responsible for review planning
- Decides on the execution of reviews
- Assigns staff, budget, and time
- Monitors ongoing cost-effectiveness
- Executes control decisions in the event of inadequate outcomes

### Facilitator (often called moderator)

- Ensures effective running of review meetings (when held)
- Mediates, if necessary, between the various points of view
- Is often the person upon whom the success of the review depends

### Review Leader

- Takes overall responsibility for the review
- Decides who will be involved and organizes when and where it will take place

### Reviewers

- May be subject matter experts, persons working on the project, stakeholders with an interest in the work product, and/or individuals with specific technical or business backgrounds
- Identify potential defects in the work product under review
- May represent different perspectives (e.g., tester, developer, user, operator, business analyst, usability expert, etc.)

### Scribe (or recorder)

- Collates potential defects found during the individual review activity
- Records new potential defects, open points, and decisions from the review meeting (when held)

In some review types, one person may play more than one role, and the actions associated with each role may also vary based on review type. In addition, with the advent of tools to support the review process, especially the logging of defects, open points, and decisions, there is often no need for a scribe.

Further, more detailed roles are possible, as described in ISO standard (ISO/IEC 20246).

## 3.2.3 Review Types

Although reviews can be used for various purposes, one of the main objectives is to uncover defects. All review types can aid in defect detection, and the selected review type should be based on the needs of the project, available resources, product type and risks, business domain, and company culture, among other selection criteria.

A single work product may be the subject of more than one type of review. If more than one type of review is used, the order may vary. For example, an informal review may be carried out before a technical review, to ensure the work product is ready for a technical review.

The types of reviews described below can be done as peer reviews, i.e., done by colleagues qualified to do the same work.

The types of defects found in a review vary, depending especially on the work product being reviewed. (See section 3.1.3 for examples of defects that can be found by reviews in different work products, and Gilb 1993 for information on formal inspections).

Reviews can be classified according to various attributes. The following lists the four most common types of reviews and their associated attributes.

### Informal Review (e.g., Buddy Check, Pairing, Pair Review)

- **Main purpose:** detecting potential defects
- **Possible additional purposes:** generating new ideas or solutions, quickly solving minor problems
- Not based on a formal (documented) process
- May not involve a review meeting
- May be performed by a colleague of the author (buddy check) or by more people
- Results may be documented
- Varies in usefulness depending on the reviewers
- Use of checklists is optional
- Very commonly used in Agile development

### Walkthrough

- **Main purposes:** find defects, improve the software product, consider alternative implementations, evaluate conformance to standards and specifications
- **Possible additional purposes:** exchanging ideas about techniques or style variations, training of participants, achieving consensus
- Individual preparation before the review meeting is optional
- Review meeting is typically led by the author of the work product
- Scribe is mandatory
- Use of checklists is optional
- May take the form of scenarios, dry runs, or simulations
- Potential defect logs and review reports are produced
- May vary in practice from quite informal to very formal

### Technical Review

- **Main purposes:** gaining consensus, detecting potential defects
- **Possible further purposes:** evaluating quality and building confidence in the work product, generating new ideas, motivating and enabling authors to improve future work products, considering alternative implementations
- Reviewers should be technical peers of the author, and technical experts in the same or other disciplines
- Individual preparation before the review meeting is required
- Review meeting is optional, ideally led by a trained facilitator (typically not the author)
- Scribe is mandatory, ideally not the author
- Use of checklists is optional
- Potential defect logs and review reports are produced

### Inspection

- **Main purposes:** detecting potential defects, evaluating quality and building confidence in the work product, preventing future similar defects through author learning and root cause analysis
- **Possible further purposes:** motivating and enabling authors to improve future work products and the software development process, achieving consensus
- Follows a defined process with formal documented outputs, based on rules and checklists
- Uses clearly defined roles, such as those specified in section 3.2.2 which are mandatory, and may include a dedicated reader (who reads the work product aloud often paraphrase, i.e. describes it in own words, during the review meeting)
- Individual preparation before the review meeting is required
- Reviewers are either peers of the author or experts in other disciplines that are relevant to the work product
