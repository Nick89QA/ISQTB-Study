### 1.4 Test Process

There is no one universal software test process, but there are common sets of test activities without which testing will be less likely to achieve its established objectives. These sets of test activities are a test process. The proper, specific software test process in any given situation depends on many factors. Which test activities are involved in this test process, how these activities are implemented, and when these activities occur may be discussed in an organizationâ€™s test strategy.

#### 1.4.1 Test Process in Context

Contextual factors that influence the test process for an organization include, but are not limited to:

- **Software development lifecycle model and project methodologies being used**
- **Test levels and test types being considered**
- **Product and project risks**
- **Business domain**
- **Operational constraints**, including but not limited to:
    - Budgets and resources
    - Timescales
    - Complexity
    - Contractual and regulatory requirements
- **Organizational policies and practices**
- **Required internal and external standards**


## The following sections describe general aspects of organizational test processes in terms of the following:

- Test activities and tasks
- Test work products
- Traceability between the test basis and test work products

It is very useful if the test basis (for any level or type of testing that is being considered) has measurable coverage criteria defined. The coverage criteria can act effectively as key performance indicators (KPIs) to drive the activities that demonstrate achievement of software test objectives (see section 1.1.1).

For example, for a mobile application, the test basis may include a list of requirements and a list of supported mobile devices. Each requirement is an element of the test basis. Each supported device is also an element of the test basis. The coverage criteria may require at least one test case for each element of the test basis. Once executed, the results of these tests tell stakeholders whether specified requirements are fulfilled and whether failures were observed on supported devices.

ISO standard (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2) has further information about test processes.

## 1.4.2 Test Activities and Tasks

A test process consists of the following main groups of activities:

- Test planning
- Test monitoring and control
- Test analysis
- Test design
- Test implementation
- Test execution
- Test completion

Each main group of activities is composed of constituent activities, which will be described in the subsections below. Each constituent activity consists of multiple individual tasks, which would vary from one project or release to another.

Further, although many of these main activity groups may appear logically sequential, they are often implemented iteratively. For example, Agile development involves small iterations of software design, build, and test that happen on a continuous basis, supported by ongoing planning. So test activities are also happening on an iterative, continuous basis within this software development approach. Even in sequential software development, the stepped logical sequence of main groups of activities will involve overlap, combination, concurrency, or omission, so tailoring these main groups of activities within the context of the system and the project is usually required.

### Test Planning

Test planning involves activities that define the objectives of testing and the approach for meeting test objectives within constraints imposed by the context (e.g., specifying suitable test techniques and tasks, and formulating a test schedule for meeting a deadline). Test plans may be revisited based on feedback from monitoring and control activities. Test planning is further explained in section 5.2.

# Test Monitoring and Control

Test monitoring involves the ongoing comparison of actual progress against planned progress using any test monitoring metrics defined in the test plan. Test control involves taking actions necessary to meet the objectives of the test plan (which may be updated over time). Test monitoring and control are supported by the evaluation of exit criteria, which are referred to as the "definition of done" in some software development lifecycle models (see ISTQB-CTFL-AT).

## Exit Criteria Evaluation

For example, the evaluation of exit criteria for test execution as part of a given test level may include:

- **Checking test results and logs** against specified coverage criteria
- **Assessing the level of component or system quality** based on test results and logs
- **Determining if more tests are needed**, for instance, if tests originally intended to achieve a certain level of product risk coverage failed to do so, requiring additional tests to be written and executed

Test progress against the plan is communicated to stakeholders in test progress reports, including deviations from the plan and information to support any decision to stop testing.

Test monitoring and control are further explained in section 5.3.

# Test Analysis

During test analysis, the test basis is analyzed to identify testable features and define associated test conditions. In other words, test analysis determines "what to test" in terms of measurable coverage criteria.

## Major Activities in Test Analysis

Test analysis includes the following major activities:

- **Analyzing the test basis** appropriate to the test level being considered, for example:
  - Requirement specifications, such as business requirements, functional requirements, system requirements, user stories, epics, use cases, or similar work products that specify desired functional and non-functional component or system behavior
  - Design and implementation information, such as system or software architecture diagrams or documents, design specifications, call flow graphs, modeling diagrams (e.g., UML or entity-relationship diagrams), interface specifications, or similar work products that specify component or system structure
  - The implementation of the component or system itself, including code, database metadata and queries, and interfaces
  - Risk analysis reports, which may consider functional, non-functional, and structural aspects of the component or system

- **Evaluating the test basis and test items** to identify defects of various types, such as:
  - Ambiguities
  - Omissions
  - Inconsistencies
  - Inaccuracies
  - Contradictions
  - Superfluous statements
