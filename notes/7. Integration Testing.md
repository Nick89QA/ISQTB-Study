### Integration Testing

#### Objectives of Integration Testing

Integration testing focuses on interactions between components or systems. Objectives of integration testing include:

- Reducing risk
- Verifying whether the functional and non-functional behaviors of the interfaces are as designed and specified
- Building confidence in the quality of the interfaces
- Finding defects (which may be in the interfaces themselves or within the components or systems)
- Preventing defects from escaping to higher test levels

As with component testing, in some cases, automated integration regression tests provide confidence that changes have not broken existing interfaces, components, or systems.

There are two different levels of integration testing described in this syllabus, which may be carried out on test objects of varying size as follows:

- **Component integration testing** focuses on the interactions and interfaces between integrated components. Component integration testing is performed after component testing and is generally automated. In iterative and incremental development, component integration tests are usually part of the continuous integration process.
- **System integration testing** focuses on the interactions and interfaces between systems, packages, and microservices. System integration testing can also cover interactions with, and interfaces provided by, external organizations (e.g., web services). In this case, the developing organization does not control the external interfaces, which can create various challenges for testing (e.g., ensuring that test-blocking defects in the external organizationâ€™s code are resolved, arranging for test environments, etc.). System integration testing may be done after system testing or in parallel with ongoing system test activities (in both sequential development and iterative and incremental development).

#### Test Basis

Examples of work products that can be used as a test basis for integration testing include:

- Software and system design
- Sequence diagrams
- Interface and communication protocol specifications
- Use cases
- Architecture at component or system level
- Workflows
- External interface definitions

#### Test Objects

Typical test objects for integration testing include:

- Subsystems
- Databases
- Infrastructure
- Interfaces
- APIs
- Microservices

#### Typical Defects and Failures

Examples of typical defects and failures for component integration testing include:

- Incorrect data, missing data, or incorrect data encoding
- Incorrect sequencing or timing of interface calls
- Interface mismatch
- Failures in communication between components
- Unhandled or improperly handled communication failures between components
- Incorrect assumptions about the meaning, units, or boundaries of the data being passed between components

Examples of typical defects and failures for system integration testing include:

- Inconsistent message structures between systems
- Incorrect data, missing data, or incorrect data encoding
- Interface mismatch
- Failures in communication between systems
- Unhandled or improperly handled communication failures between systems
- Incorrect assumptions about the meaning, units, or boundaries of the data being passed between systems
- Failure to comply with mandatory security regulations
