### 3.1 Static Testing Overview

In contrast to dynamic testing, which requires the execution of software, static testing involves manual examination of work products (e.g., reviews) or tool-driven analysis (e.g., static analysis). These methods help assess the quality of work products without executing them. Static analysis is often critical in safety-critical systems and is also widely used in security testing and automated build processes (e.g., in Agile).

---

### 3.1.1 Work Products for Static Testing

Static testing can be applied to a wide range of work products, including:
- Specifications (business, functional, security requirements)
- Epics, user stories, acceptance criteria
- Architecture and design documents
- Code
- Testware (test plans, test cases, scripts)
- User guides, web pages, contracts
- Project plans, schedules, and budgets
- Models (e.g., activity diagrams for Model-Based Testing)

Static analysis can be applied to formalized work products (code, models) and even to natural language products (e.g., checking requirements for readability, spelling).

---

### 3.1.2 Benefits of Static Testing

Static testing provides numerous benefits:
- Early detection of defects (before dynamic testing)
- Cheaper defect fixes (especially when caught early)
- Identifying defects not easily found through dynamic testing
- Preventing defects by finding issues in requirements and design (e.g., ambiguities, contradictions)
- Improving productivity and maintainability of code
- Reducing cost and time in development and testing
- Improving communication within the team through reviews

---

### 3.1.3 Differences Between Static and Dynamic Testing

Both static and dynamic testing aim to assess work product quality and detect defects, but they achieve this differently:
- Static testing finds defects in the work product directly, while dynamic testing finds failures caused by defects during software execution.
- Static testing can detect defects that might never cause failures during dynamic tests (e.g., unreachable code).
- Static testing improves internal quality (consistency, structure) of work products, while dynamic testing focuses on externally visible behavior.

Types of defects found more easily through static testing include:
- Requirement defects (e.g., inconsistencies, ambiguities)
- Design defects (e.g., inefficient algorithms, high coupling)
- Coding defects (e.g., unused variables, unreachable code)
- Deviations from standards
- Security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows)
- Gaps in traceability or coverage of test bases

Additionally, maintainability defects (e.g., poor modularization) are primarily found via static testing.

### FL-3.2.3
(K2) Explain the differences between different review types: informal review, walkthrough, technical review, and inspection.

### FL-3.2.4
(K3) Apply a review technique to a work product to find defects.

### FL-3.2.5
(K2) Explain the factors that contribute to a successful review.

## 3.1 Static Testing Basics

In contrast to **dynamic testing**, which requires software execution, **static testing** relies on the manual examination of work products (e.g., reviews) or tool-driven evaluation of code or other work products (e.g., static analysis). Static testing evaluates the code or work product without execution.

**Static analysis** is crucial for **safety-critical systems** (e.g., aviation, medical, nuclear software) and is also essential in other contexts, like security testing. It's commonly used in **Agile**, **continuous delivery**, and **continuous deployment** processes.

### 3.1.1 Work Products That Can Be Examined by Static Testing

Static testing (reviews and/or static analysis) can be applied to nearly any work product, including:
- **Specifications** (business, functional, security requirements)
- **Epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria**
- **Architecture and design specifications**
- **Code**
- **Testware** (test plans, test cases, test procedures, automated test scripts)
- **User guides**
- **Web pages**
- **Contracts, project plans, schedules, and budgets**
- **Configuration and infrastructure setup**
- **Models** (e.g., activity diagrams for Model-Based Testing)

**Reviews** are applicable to any product that participants can read and understand. **Static analysis** is most efficient for formal structures (e.g., code, models) but can also be applied to natural language products (e.g., requirements checking for spelling, grammar, and readability).

---

### 3.1.2 Benefits of Static Testing

Static testing provides multiple benefits when applied early in the software development lifecycle, allowing early detection of defects before dynamic testing. This approach results in cost-effective defect removal, especially compared to the cost of fixing defects found later in the lifecycle (e.g., post-deployment).

Benefits include:
- Detecting defects **before dynamic test execution**
- Identifying defects **not easily found by dynamic testing**
- **Preventing defects** in design or coding (e.g., inconsistencies, ambiguities, inaccuracies)
- Increasing development **productivity** and code maintainability
- Reducing **development** and **testing** cost and time
- Lowering **total cost of quality** over the softwareâ€™s lifecycle
- Improving team communication during review processes

### 3.1.3 Differences Between Static and Dynamic Testing

Static and dynamic testing share objectives (e.g., quality assessment, early defect detection), but they uncover different types of defects.

#### Key Differences:
- **Static testing** finds defects directly in work products (e.g., unexecuted code).
- **Dynamic testing** identifies failures caused by defects during software execution.
- Static testing is better at finding defects in rarely exercised or hard-to-reach paths.
- Static testing improves the **internal quality** of work products, whereas dynamic testing focuses on **externally visible behavior**.

#### Defects Found by Static Testing:
- **Requirement defects** (inconsistencies, ambiguities, omissions)
- **Design defects** (inefficient algorithms, high coupling, low cohesion)
- **Coding defects** (undefined variables, unreachable code, duplicate code)
- **Deviations from standards** (non-adherence to coding standards)
- **Interface specification errors** (e.g., mismatched units between systems)
- **Security vulnerabilities** (e.g., buffer overflows)
- **Gaps in test basis traceability** or **coverage**

Additionally, **maintainability defects** (e.g., improper modularization, poor reusability) are mostly detected via static testing.
