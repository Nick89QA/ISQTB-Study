### Test Monitoring and Control

The **purpose of test monitoring** is to gather information and provide feedback and visibility about test activities. Information to be monitored may be collected manually or automatically and should be used to assess test progress and to measure whether the test exit criteria, or the testing tasks associated with an Agile project's definition of done, are satisfied. This includes meeting the targets for coverage of product risks, requirements, or acceptance criteria.

**Test control** describes any guiding or corrective actions taken as a result of information and metrics gathered and (possibly) reported. Actions may cover any test activity and may affect any other software lifecycle activity.
