### Learning Objectives for Test Tools

- **FL-6.2.1 (K1)**: Identify the main principles for selecting a tool.
- **FL-6.2.2 (K1)**: Recall the objectives for using pilot projects to introduce tools.
- **FL-6.2.3 (K1)**: Identify the success factors for evaluation, implementation, deployment, and ongoing support of test tools in an organization.

### 6.1 Test Tool Considerations

Test tools are used to support various testing activities, including:

- **Test execution tools** and **test data preparation tools**.
- Tools for managing **requirements**, **test cases**, **test procedures**, **automated test scripts**, **test results**, **test data**, **defects**, and for **reporting** and **monitoring** test execution.
- Tools for **analysis** and **evaluation**.
- Even simple tools like **spreadsheets** are considered test tools in this context.

### 6.1.1 Test Tool Classification

Test tools serve different purposes based on context and can be classified by their goals:

- **Efficiency improvement**: Automating repetitive or resource-intensive tasks (e.g., test execution, regression testing).
- **Manual test support**: Assisting manual test activities (throughout the process).
- **Quality improvement**: Ensuring more consistent testing and defect reproducibility.
- **Automation of non-manual activities**: Testing that cannot be performed manually (e.g., large-scale performance testing).
- **Reliability enhancement**: Automation of tasks that increase testing reliability (e.g., large data comparisons or behavior simulations).

Test tools are classified by their primary **test activity** support:

- Some tools support a single activity, while others may support multiple activities but are classified based on their closest association.
- Tools from a single provider may form an **integrated suite**.

**Probe Effect**: Some tools are **intrusive** and may affect the test outcome. For instance, **performance testing tools** may alter response times, or **coverage tools** may distort code coverage results.

### Tool Support for Management of Testing and Testware

Management tools span multiple test activities over the software development lifecycle. Examples include:

- **Test management tools** and **application lifecycle management (ALM) tools**.
- **Requirements management tools** (e.g., traceability to test objects).
- **Defect management tools**.

### Learning Objectives for Tool Classification and Usage

- **FL-6.1.1 (K2)**: Classify test tools by their purpose and the test activities they support.
- **FL-6.1.2 (K1)**: Identify benefits and risks of test automation.
- **FL-6.1.3 (K1)**: Remember special considerations for test execution and test management tools.
