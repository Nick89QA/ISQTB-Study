   After component testing

7. Which is not a black testing technique?
   Decision testing

8. Which of the following is a KEY test control task?
   Initiating corrective actions

9. As a test leader you are collecting measures about defects. You recognize that after the first test cycle-covering all
  the requirements-subsystem "C" has defect density that is 150% higher than the average. Subsystem "A" on the other hand has a defect density
  that is 60% lower than the average. What conclusions for the next test cycle could you draw from this fact?
  It is probable that subsystem C has still more hidden defects. Therefore we need to test subsystem C in more detail
